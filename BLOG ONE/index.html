            Colonization simply means the act of sending people to live and govern another country. Europeans travelled from Europe into African kingdoms, empires and states  e.g Oyo, Benin, Igbo states, Hausa states, Kanu, Borno (Nigeria). <br><br>They conquered the people and the country (Nigeria) and established their control over the area as they ruled. This means the British colonized Nigeria.
